Every user interaction that makes a change to the game state should go through one central place -> GameCommandService
	-	Replays save/load etc
	-	RandomNumber service - seed
	-	Should be possible to run the game without graphics
	-	Should be possible to run the game without graphics, and then attach the graphics to it, i.e. generate graphics at any time from given state
	-	Shuttle landing directly calls the WorkerCreationService, should it not invoke the GameCommandService???

Message Queue/Bus
	-	This is how we notify the view that a tile has changed etc
	-	How an entity enters/leaves a tile etc

Beds
	-	Just provide the sleep need, aren't required

Tiles can reveal things when mined
	-	Enhance rooms (mining x 2)
	-	Haunted room (needs decline x 2)

Services should be stateless?
	-	E.g. ShuttleDepartureService -> Shouldn't have member variables, instead have ShuttleDepartureData, and take reference to it

WorkerRecruitmentService
	-	Gets available workers for different jobs
		-	Can set max pay etc etc
EconomyService
	-	Over time different resources are worth different amounts, go down if you saturate the market etc
	-	

~~~~~~~~~~ Done ~~~~~~~~~~
Create std::function enhanced for testing, with is invoked method
	-	Times (Once, twice never, X etc...)
